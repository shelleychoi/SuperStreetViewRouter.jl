    solve_graph_greedy(city::City=read_city())

Generates a greedy solution to the provided city, or uses the default
city if none is provided. The greedy algorithm can be described as follows:
    - At each junction, the car will choose to traverse the street with the
    highest "value" = length / time.
    - Traversed streets will be recorded.
    - Traversed streets will have their length decreased by a constant factor
    to discourage but allow usage. This constant is likely a responsive to
    optimization.

Inefficient due to only routing a single path at a time. Implementing a
shared list of traversed streets and dedicating a separate thread to each path
would likely improve performance.
